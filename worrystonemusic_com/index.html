“There are only two things to worry about, 
either you arehealthy or you are sick. 
If you are healthy, then there is nothingto worry about. 
But if you are sick there are only two things toworry about, 
either you will get well or you will die. 
If you get well, then there is nothing to worry about. 
But if you die there are only two things to worry about, 
either you will go to heaven or to hell. 
If you go to heaven, then there is nothing to worry about. 
And if you to go hell, you'll be so darn busy shaking hands with your friends you won't have time to worry.”
